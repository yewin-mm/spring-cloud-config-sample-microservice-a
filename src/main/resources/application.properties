# below application name is keypoint to choose which config file will use for this application as there can have many config files under config repository.
# because there might have many microservice applications in real world which use only one config repository and might put many config properties files in that config repository.
# you need to change this application name as per your config file name (map that properties file with this application) which is at another repository,
# eg. if you changed your config file name (which is already committed into git)
# eg.1. if you changed into `aa-application.properties`, you need to change below application name to `aa-application`
# eg.2. if you changed into `aa.properties`, you need to change below application name to `aa`

# Most of the Spring boot actuator APIs are close by default including refresh api,
# So, we need to enable like below, you can also open other actuator APIs like emv, info, etc.
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=refresh,health,env
# I do allow `refresh` api because we will use refresh properties which not to restart this application when we changed something in config properties file which are put at config folder repo.
# So, even you changed the value from properties file, you don't need to restart the application again to get those updated values.
# You just need to call refresh api to get updated values, http://localhost:8080/cloud-config-service-a/actuator/refresh
# But you need to commit that properties file to reach config repo first.

# you can allow all built-in endpoints by adding * like below which provided by spring boot actuator.

# here, you can't use encrypted value like below `{cipher} key` because this properties file will only use as default when the config server is not running well.
# So, encryption won't be work as we added encrypted logic through config server.
